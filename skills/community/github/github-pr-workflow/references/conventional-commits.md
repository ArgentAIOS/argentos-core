## Quick Decision Guide

- Added something new? → `feat`
- Something was broken and you fixed it? → `fix`
- Changed how code is organized but not what it does? → `refactor`
- Only touched tests? → `test`
- Only touched docs? → `docs`
- Updated CI/CD pipelines? → `ci`
- Updated dependencies or tooling? → `chore`
- Made something faster? → `perf`
